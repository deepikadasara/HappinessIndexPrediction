# HappinessIndexPrediction
The pursuit of happiness and well-being has gained significant recognition worldwide as essential com- ponents of societal progress and development. On 28 June 2012, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 66/281, designating 20 March as the International Day of Happiness. Aligned with this celebration, the World Happiness Report is released annually around March 20th.
The happiness score/index holds significant value and offers numerous benefits. Predicting it is cru- cial for policymakers, enabling them to make informed decisions that enhance citizen well-being. It facilitates efficient resource allocation by targeting interventions to areas with lower predicted happi- ness scores, ensuring effective utilization. Moreover, it enables comparative analysis across countries, providing valuable insights into the factors that shape happiness variations and guiding the adoption of successful strategies on a global scale.

In this project, my aim is to delve into the factors that contribute to the calculation of the happiness score, a measure of overall well-being. I will focus on variables such as GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, population, social support, freedom to make life choices, Covid-19 deaths, and perceptions of corruption.

Through the use of multi-linear regression, I will predict the happiness score based on these vari- ables. Additionally, I will employ correlation techniques to explore any relationships that may exist among these variables. The unit of analysis for this project will be country-wise, providing insights into the happiness factors on a national level.
